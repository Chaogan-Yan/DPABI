% Computes a minimal norm convex combination of given tangent vectors in Manopt.

% function [u_norm, coeffs, u] = smallestinconvexhull(M, x, U)
% function [u_norm, coeffs, u] = smallestinconvexhull(M, x, U, tol)
%
% M is a manifold as returned by a Manopt factory.
% x is a point on this manifold.
% U is a cell containing N tangent vectors U{1} to U{N} at x.
% tol (default: 1e-8): tolerance for solving the quadratic program.
% 
% This function computes u, a tangent vector at x contained in the convex
% hull spanned by the N vectors U{i}, with minimal norm (according to the
% Riemannian metric on M). This is obtained by solving a convex quadratic
% program involving the Gram matrix of the given tangent vectors.
% The quadratic program is solved using Matlab's built-in quadprog,
% which requires the optimization toolbox. If this toolbox is not
% available, consider replacing with CVX for example.
%
%
% u_norm is the norm of the smallest vector u.
% coeffs is a vector of length N with entries in [0, 1] summing to 1.
% u is the sought vector: u = coeffs(1)*U{1} + ... + coeffs(N)*U{N}.

% Example code: pick a manifold, a point, and a collection of tangent
% vectors at that point, then get the smallest vector in the convex hull
% of those:
% 
% M = spherefactory(5);
% x = M.rand();
% N = 3;
% U = cell(N,1);
% for k = 1 : N, U{k} = M.randvec(x); end
% [u_norm, coeffs, u] = smallestinconvexhull(M, x, U)

    % We simply need to solve the following quadratic program:
    % minimize ||u||^2 such that u = sum_i s_i U_i, 0 <= s_i <= 1
    %                            and sum_i s_i = 1
    %
    % This is equivalent to solving:
    %  min s'*G*s s.t. 0 <= s <= 1, s'*ones = 1, with G(i, j) = <U_i, U_j> (Gram matrix)
    % Then our solution is s_1 U_1 + ... + s_N U_N.
    
    
    % Compute the Gram matrix of the given tangent vectors
    N = numel(U);
    G = grammatrix(M, x, U);
    
    % Solve the quadratic program.
    % If the optimization toolbox is not available, consider replacing with
    % CVX.
