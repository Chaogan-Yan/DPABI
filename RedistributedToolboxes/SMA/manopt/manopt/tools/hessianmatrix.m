function [H, basis] = hessianmatrix(problem, x, basis)
% Computes a matrix which represents the Hessian in some tangent basis.
%
% [H, basis] = hessianmatrix(problem, x)
% [H, basis] = hessianmatrix(problem, x, basis)
%
% problem is a Manopt problem structure with a manifold and cost function.
% x is a point on the manifold problem.M.
% basis (optional) is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space to the
% manifold at x. If no basis is supplied, one will be generated at random.
% If the basis spans only a subspace of the tangent space at x,
% then the returned matrix represents the Hessian restricted to that subspace.
%
% H is an n-by-n symmetric matrix (with n the number of vectors in the basis)
% such that H(i, j) is the inner product between basis{i}
% and Hess(basis{j}), with respect to the metric on the tangent space to
% problem.M at x, where Hess(basis{j}) is the vector obtained after
% applying the Hessian at x to basis{j}.
%
% For optimization, it is usually not useful to compute the Hessian matrix,
% as this quickly becomes expensive. This tool is provided mostly for
% exploration and debugging rather than to be used algorithmically in
% solvers. To access the spectrum of the Hessian, it may be more practical
% to call hessianextreme or hessianspectrum. This should coincide with eig(H).
%
%
% Example of equivalence:
%
%     Hu = getHessian(problem, x, u)
%
% is equivalent to (but much faster than):
%
%     B = tangentorthobasis(M, x);
%     H = hessianmatrix(problem, x, B);
%     u_vec = tangent2vec(M, x, B, u);
%     Hu_vec = H*u_vec;
%     Hu = lincomb(M, x, B, Hu_vec);
%
% Note that there will be some error due to numerical round-off.
