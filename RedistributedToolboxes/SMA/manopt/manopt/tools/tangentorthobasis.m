function orthobasis = tangentorthobasis(M, x, n)
% Returns an orthonormal basis of tangent vectors in the Manopt framework.

% function orthobasis = tangentorthobasis(M, x)
% function orthobasis = tangentorthobasis(M, x, n)
%
% M is a Manopt manifold structure obtained from a factory.
% x is a point on the manifold M.
% n (optional) is the dimension of the random subspace to span; by default,
%   n = M.dim() so that the returned basis spans the whole tangent space.
%
% orthobasis is a cell of n tangent vectors at x.
% With high probability, they form an orthonormal basis of the tangent
% space at x. If necessary, this can be checked by calling
%   G = grammatrix(M, x, orthobasis)
% and verifying that norm(G - eye(size(G))) is close to zero.
%
% Note: if extra accuracy is required, it may help to re-orthogonalize the
% basis returned by this function once, as follows:
%  B = tangentorthobasis(M, x, n);
%  B = orthogonalize(M, x, B);
