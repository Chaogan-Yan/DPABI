function [y, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, y0, options, storedb, key)
% Compute an extreme eigenvector / eigenvalue of the Hessian of a problem.
%
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x)
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side)
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0)
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0, options)
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0, options, storedb)
% [u, lambda, info] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0, options, storedb, key)
% 
% (For side, u0 and options, pass [] to omit any.)
%
% Given a Manopt problem structure and a point x on the manifold problem.M,
% this function computes a tangent vector u at x of unit norm such that the
% Hessian quadratic form is minimized or maximized:
%
%    minimize or maximize <u, Hess f(x)[u]> such that <u, u> = 1,
%
% where <.,.> is the Riemannian metric on the tangent space at x. Choose
% between minimizing and maximizing by setting side = 'min' or 'max', with
% 'min' being the default. The value attained is returned as lambda, and
% is the minimal or maximal eigenvalue of the Hessian (actually, the last
% value attained when the solver stopped). This is a real number since the
% Hessian is a symmetric operator.
%
% If u0 is specified, it should be a unit-norm tangent vector at x. It is
% then used as initial guess to solve the above problem. Pass [] to omit.
%
% The options structure, if provided, will be passed along to manoptsolve.
% As such, you may choose which solver to use to solve the above
% optimization problem by setting options.solver. See manoptsolve's help.
% The other options will be passed along to the chosen solver too.
% Pass [] to omit.
%
% Often times, it is only necessary to compute a vector u such that the
% quadratic form is negative, if that is at all possible. To do so, set the
% following stopping criterion: options.tolcost = -1e-10; (for example)
% and side = 'min'. The solver will return as soon as the quadratic cost
% defined above drops below the set value (or sooner if another stopping
% criterion triggers first.)
%
% storedb is a StoreDB object, key is the StoreDB key to point x.
%
% info is the info struct-array returned by the solver.

% Change log: 
%
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   May 7, 2015 (NB):
%       Default solver options: verbosity = 0 and defaults to trustregions.
%
%   Nov 27, 2015 (NB):
%       The function now also returns the info struct-array.

    
    % By default, minimize
    if ~exist('side', 'var') || isempty(side)
        side = 'min';
    end
    
    % If no initial guess was specified, prepare the empty one.
    if ~exist('y0', 'var')
        y0 = [];
    end

    % Merge default solver options with potential user-specified options.
    % Set local defaults here
    localdefaults.verbosity = 0;
    localdefaults.solver = @trustregions;
    if ~exist('options', 'var') || isempty(options)
        options = struct();
    end
    options = mergeOptions(localdefaults, options);

    % Allow omission of the key, and even of storedb.
    if ~exist('key', 'var')
        if ~exist('storedb', 'var')
            storedb = StoreDB();
        end
        key = storedb.getNewKey();
    end
    
    % Convert the side into a sign.
    % Since Manopt minimizes, 'min' asks for no sign change.
    switch lower(side)
        case 'min'

    % We define a manifold that is actually the unit sphere on the tangent
    % space to problem.M at x. A generalization would be to consider
    % Stiefel or Grassmann on the tangent space, but this would require
    % manipulating collections of tangent vectors, which in full generality
    % may be more complex (from a programming point of view).
    % Points are represented as tangent vectors of unit norm.
    % Tangent vectors are represented as tangent vectors orthogonal to the
    % root point, with respect to the Riemannian metric on the tangent
    % space.

    M = problem.M;
    
    % N is the manifold we build. y will be a point on N, thus also a
    % tangent vector to M at x. This is a typical Riemannian submanifold of
    % a Euclidean space, hence it is easy to describe in terms of the tools
    % available for M.
    N = tangentspherefactory(M, x);

    % sure precomputable things are precomputed.

    % problem on the sphere N.
