function b = multihconj(a, dim)
%MULTIHCONJ  Hermitian conjugating arrays of matrices.
%    B = MULTIHCONJ(A) is equivalent to B = MULTIHCONJ(A, DIM), where
%    DIM = 1.
%
%    B = MULTIHCONJ(A, DIM) is equivalent to
%    B = PERMUTE(A, [1:DIM-1, DIM+1, DIM, DIM+2:NDIMS(A)]), where A is an
%    array containing N P-by-Q matrices along its dimensions DIM and DIM+1,
%    and B is an array containing the Q-by-P Hermitian conjugate (') of
%    those N matrices along the same dimensions. N = NUMEL(A) / (P*Q), i.e.
%    N is equal to the number of elements in A divided by the number of
%    elements in each matrix.
%
%
%    Example:
%       A 5-by-9-by-3-by-2 array may be considered to be a block array
%       containing ten 9-by-3 matrices along dimensions 2 and 3. In this
%       case, its size is so indicated:  5-by-(9-by-3)-by-2 or 5x(9x3)x2.
%       If A is ................ a 5x(9x3)x2 array of 9x3 matrices,
%       C = MULTIHCONJ(A, 2) is a 5x(3x9)x2 array of 3x9 matrices.
