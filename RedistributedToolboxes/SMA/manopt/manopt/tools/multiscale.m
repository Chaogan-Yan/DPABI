function A = multiscale(scale, A)
% Multiplies the 2D slices in a 3D matrix by individual scalars.
%
% function A = multiscale(scale, A)
%
% Given a vector scale of length N and a 3-dimensional matrix A of size
% n-by-m-by-N, returns a matrix A of same size such that
% A(:, :, k) := scale(k) * A(:, :, k);
