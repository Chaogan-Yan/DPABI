function G = grammatrix(M, x, vectors)
% Computes the Gram matrix of tangent vectors in the Manopt framework.
%
% function G = grammatrix(M, x, vectors)
%
% M is a Manopt manifold structure obtained from a factory.
% x is a point on the manifold M.
% vectors is a cell containing n tangent vectors at x.
%
% G is an n-by-n symmetric positive semidefinite matrix such that G(i, j)
% is the inner product between vectors{i} and vectors{j}, with respect to
% the metric on the tangent space to M at x.
