function vec = tangent2vec(M, x, basis, u)
% Expands a tangent vector into an orthogonal basis in the Manopt framework
%
% vec = tangent2vec(M, x, basis, u)
%
% The inverse operation is lincomb (see below).
%
% M is a Manopt manifold structure obtained from a factory.
% x is a point on the manifold M.
% basis is a cell containing n orthonormal tangent vectors at x, forming an
%       orthonormal basis of the tangent space at x.
% u is a tangent vector at x
%
% vec is a column vector of length n which contains the coefficients of the
%     expansion of u into the basis. Thus:
%
%    vec(k) = <basis{k}, u>_x          <- vec = tangent2vec(M, x, basis, u)
%
%    u = sum_{k=1}^n  vec(k)*basis{k}    <- u = lincomb(M, x, basis, vec)
%
% Note that tangent2vec is an isometry, that is, up to numerical round-off
% errors, with u and v two tangent vectors at x:
%
%    M.inner(x, u, v)  ==  uu'*vv,
%
% where uu = tangent2vec(M, x, basis, u), vv = tangent2vec(M, x, basis, v).
