%
% checkhessian performs a numerical test to check that the directional
% derivatives and Hessian defined in the problem structure agree up to
% second order with the cost function at some point x, along some direction
% d. The test is based on a truncated Taylor series (see online Manopt
% documentation).
% 
% It is also tested that the result of applying the Hessian along that
% direction is indeed a tangent vector, and that the Hessian operator is
% symmetric w.r.t. the Riemannian metric.
% 
% Both x and d are optional and will be sampled at random if omitted.

%
%   March 26, 2017 (JB):
%       Detects if the approximated quadratic model is exact
%       and provides the user with the corresponding feedback.
% 
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   Nov. 1, 2016 (NB):
%       Issues a call to getGradient rather than getDirectionalDerivative.

        
    % Verify that the problem description is sufficient.
