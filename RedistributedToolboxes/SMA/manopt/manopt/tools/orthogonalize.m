% Orthonormalizes a basis of tangent vectors in the Manopt framework.

% function [orthobasis, L] = orthogonalize(M, x, basis)
%
% M is a Manopt manifold structure obtained from a factory.
% x is a point on the manifold M.
% basis is a cell containing n linearly independent tangent vectors at x.
%
% orthobasis is a cell of same size as basis which contains an orthonormal
% basis for the same subspace as that spanned by basis. Orthonormality is
% assessed with respect to the metric on the tangent space to M at x.
% L is upper triangular of size n x n if basis has n vectors, such that,
% basis{k} = sum_j=1^k orthobasis{j} * L(j, k) (akin to R in a QR
% factorization.)

    % Build the Gram matrix of the basis vectors.
    G = grammatrix(M, x, basis);
    
    % If the vectors in 'basis' were the columns of V, and the inner
    % product were the classical dot product, then G = V'*V. We are looking
    % for R, an invertible matrix such that V*R is orthogonal. Thus, R
    % satisfies R'*V'*V*R = eye(n); equivalently:
    %  G = inv(R)'*inv(R).
    % Computing a Cholesky factorization of G yields L such that G = L'*L.
    % Thus, R = inv(L). Each column of R states exactly which linear
    % combinations of the vectors in 'basis' must be computed to produce
    % the orthonormal basis.
    %
    % Of course, in that formalism, we could directly take a qr of V, but
    % in the actual setting V is not available; the only simple object
    % available is G.
	%
	% If this simple code turns out not to be satisfactory (most likely
	% because of numerical instability), it may be good to consider
	% implementing a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm instead, and even to
	% provide a helper function which calls it twice.
