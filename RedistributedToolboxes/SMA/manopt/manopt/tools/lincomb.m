function vec = lincomb(M, x, vecs, coeffs)
% Computes a linear combination of tangent vectors in the Manopt framework.
%
% vec = lincomb(M, x, vecs, coeffs)
%
% M is a Manopt manifold structure obtained from a factory.
% x is a point on the manifold M.
% vecs is a cell containing n tangent vectors at x.
% coeffs is a vector of length n
%
% vec is a tangent vector at x obtained as the linear combination
%
%    vec = coeffs(1)*vecs{1} + ... + coeffs(n)*vecs{n}
%
% If vecs is an orthonormal basis, then tangent2vec is the inverse of
% lincomb.
