function N = tangentspacefactory(M, x)
% Returns a manifold structure representing the tangent space to M at x.
%
% N = tangentspacefactory(M, x)
%
% N defines a (linear) manifold that is the tangent space to M at x. Points
% are represented as tangent vectors to M at x. Tangent vectors are also
% represented as tangent vectors to M at x.
%
% This is chiefly useful to solve optimization problems involving tangent
% vectors to M at x, which notably comes up when solving linear systems
% involving, for example, the Hessian of the cost on M at x (think of the
% Newton equations.) The Riemannian (actually, Euclidean) structure on N is
% that of the tangent space to M, that is, the inner product is inherited.

%   Jan. 25, 2017 (NB):
%       Following a comment by Jesus Briales on the Manopt forum, the
%       functions N.egrad2rgrad, N.ehess2rhess and N.tangent now include a
%       projection (they were formerly identities.)
%
%   Feb. 2, 2017 (NB):
%       Following a comment by Jesus Briales on the Manopt forum, the
%       function N.proj now calls M.proj(x, .) instead of M.proj(y, .).
%       Furthermore, N.ehess2rhess was corrected in the same way.

    % N is the manifold we build. y will be a point on N, thus also a
    % tangent vector to M at x. This is a typical Euclidean space, hence it
    % will be easy to describe in terms of the tools available for M.
