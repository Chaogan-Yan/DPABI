% function [range poly] = identify_linear_piece(x, y, window_length)
%
% This function attempts to identify a contiguous segment of the curve
% defined by the vectors x and y that appears to be linear. A line is fit
% through the data over all windows of length window_length and the best
% fit is retained. The output specifies the range of indices such that
% x(range) is the portion over which (x, y) is the most linear and the
% output poly specifies a first order polynomial that best fits (x, y) over
% that range, following the usual matlab convention for polynomials
% (highest degree coefficients first).
