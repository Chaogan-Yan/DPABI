% function t = getLinesearch(problem, x, d, storedb)
% function t = getLinesearch(problem, x, d, storedb, key)
%
% For a line-search problem at x along the tangent direction d, computes
% and returns t such that retracting t*d at x yields a good point around
% where to look for a line-search solution. That is: t is a hint as to
% "how far to look" along the line.
% 
% storedb is a StoreDB object, key is the StoreDB key to point x.
