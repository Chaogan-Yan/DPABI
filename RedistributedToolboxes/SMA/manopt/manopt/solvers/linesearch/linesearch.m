% function [stepsize, newx, newkey, lsstats] = 
%                 linesearch(problem, x, d, f0, df0, options, storedb, key)
%
% Base line-search algorithm for descent methods, based on a simple
% backtracking method. The search direction provided has to be a descent
% direction, as indicated by a negative df0 = directional derivative of f
% at x along d.
%
% The algorithm is invariant under positive scaling of the cost function
% and under offsetting, that is: if the cost function f is replaced by
% 8*f+3 for example, the returned step size will be the same. Furthermore,
% the returned step size is independent of the norm of the search direction
% vector d: only the direction of d is important.
% 
% Below, the step is constructed as alpha*d, and the step size is the norm
% of that vector, thus: stepsize = alpha*norm_d. The step is executed by
% retracting the vector alpha*d from the current point x, giving newx.
%
% This line-search may create and maintain a structure called lsmem inside
% storedb.internal. This gives the linesearch the opportunity to remember
% what happened in the previous calls. This is typically used to make a
% first guess at the step size, based on previous events.
%
% Inputs
%
%  problem : structure holding the description of the optimization problem
%  x : current point on the manifold problem.M
%  d : tangent vector at x (descent direction) -- its norm is irrelevant
%  f0 : cost value at x
%  df0 : directional derivative at x along d
%  options : options structure (see in code for usage)
%  storedb : StoreDB object (handle class: passed by reference) for caching
%  key : key associated to point x in storedb
%
%  options, storedb and key are optional.
%
% Outputs
%
%  stepsize : norm of the vector retracted to reach newx from x.
%  newx : next iterate suggested by the line-search algorithm, such that
%         the retraction at x of the vector alpha*d reaches newx.
%  newkey : key associated to newx in storedb
%  lsstats : statistics about the line-search procedure
%            (stepsize, number of trials etc).

% Change log: 
%
%	Sept. 13, 2013 (NB):
%       User control over the parameters of the linesearch via the options
%       ls_contraction_factor, ls_optimism, ls_suff_decr and ls_max_steps.
%       See in code for the effect of those.
% 
%   Sept. 13, 2013 (NB):
%       The automatic direction reversal feature was removed (it triggered
%       when df0 > 0). Direction reversal is a decision that needs to be
%       made by the solver, so it can know about it.
% 
%	Sept. 13, 2013 (NB):
%       The linesearch is now invariant under rescaling of the cost
%       function f. That is, if f is replaced by 8*f (and hence the
%       directional derivatives of f are scaled accordingly), the
%       stepsizes computed will not change.
% 
%   Nov. 7, 2013 (NB):
%       The linesearch is now invariant under rescaling of the search
%       direction d. The meaning of stepsize is also more clear in the
%       comments. Added a parameter ls_initial_stepsize to give users
%       control over the first step size trial.
%
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   April 8, 2015 (NB):
%       Got rid of lsmem input/output: now maintained in storedb.internal.
%
%   Oct. 7, 2016 (NB):
%       Thanks to Wen Huang, a bug was corrected in the logic around
%       lsmem handling. Specifically, lsmem = storedb.internal.lsmem;
%       was erroneously coded as lsmem = storedb.internal;


    % Allow omission of the key, and even of storedb.
    if ~exist('key', 'var')
        if ~exist('storedb', 'var')
            storedb = StoreDB();
        end

    % Compute the norm of the search direction.
    % This is useful to make the linesearch algorithm invariant under the
    % scaling of d. The rationale is that the important information is the
    % search direction, not the size of that vector. The question of how
    % far we should go is precisely what the linesearch algorithm is
    % supposed to answer: the calling algorithm should not need to care.

    % At first, we have no idea of what the step size should be.
    alpha = NaN;

    % that to compute an initial guess for the step size, as inspired from
    % Nocedal&Wright, p59.

            % and go look a little further (or less far), just in case.
            alpha = optimism*alpha;
        end
    end
    
    % If we have no information about the previous iteration (maybe this is
    % the first one?) or if the above formula gave a too small step size
    % (perhaps it is even negative), then fall back to a user supplied
    % suggestion for the first step size (the "a priori").
    % At any rate, the choice should be invariant under rescaling of the
    % cost function f and of the search direction d, and it should be
    % bounded away from zero for convergence guarantees. We must allow it
    % to be close to zero though, for fine convergence.

        % Reduce the step size,
        alpha = contraction_factor * alpha;

        % Make sure we don't run out of budget
        if cost_evaluations >= max_ls_steps
            break;

    % As seen outside this function, stepsize is the size of the vector we
    % retract to make the step from x to newx. Since the step is alpha*d:
