function R = randrot(n, N)
% Generates uniformly random rotation matrices.
%
% function R = randrot(n, N)
%
% R is a n-by-n-by-N matrix such that each slice R(:, :, i) is an
% orthogonal matrix of size n of determinant +1 (i.e., a matrix in SO(n)).
% By default, N = 1.
% Complexity: N times O(n^3).
% Theory in Diaconis and Shahshahani 1987 for the uniformity on O(n);
% With details in Mezzadri 2007,
% "How to generate random matrices from the classical compact groups."
% To ensure matrices in SO(n), we permute the two first columns when
% the determinant is -1.
