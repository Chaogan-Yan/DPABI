% function M = fixedrankembeddedfactory(m, n, k)
%
% Manifold of m-by-n real matrices of fixed rank k. This follows the
% embedded geometry described in Bart Vandereycken's 2013 paper:
% "Low-rank matrix completion by Riemannian optimization".

%
% A point X on the manifold is represented as a structure with three
% fields: U, S and V. The matrices U (mxk) and V (nxk) are orthonormal,
% while the matrix S (kxk) is any /diagonal/, full rank matrix.
% Following the SVD formalism, X = U*S*V'. Note that the diagonal entries
% of S are not constrained to be nonnegative.
%
% Tangent vectors are represented as a structure with three fields: Up, M
% and Vp. The matrices Up (mxk) and Vp (mxk) obey Up'*U = 0 and Vp'*V = 0.
% The matrix M (kxk) is arbitrary. Such a structure corresponds to the
% following tangent vector in the ambient space of mxn matrices:
%   Z = U*M*V' + Up*V' + U*Vp'
% where (U, S, V) is the current point and (Up, M, Vp) is the tangent
% vector at that point.
%
% Vectors in the ambient space are best represented as mxn matrices. If
% these are low-rank, they may also be represented as structures with
% U, S, V fields, such that Z = U*S*V'. There are no resitrictions on what
% U, S and V are, as long as their product as indicated yields a real, mxn
% matrix.
%
% The chosen geometry yields a Riemannian submanifold of the embedding
% space R^(mxn) equipped with the usual trace (Frobenius) inner product.

% Change log: 
%
%	Feb. 20, 2014 (NB):
%       Added function tangent to work with checkgradient.
%
%   June 24, 2014 (NB):
%       A couple modifications following
%       Bart Vandereycken's feedback:
%       - The checksum (hash) was replaced for a faster alternative: it's a
%         bit less "safe" in that collisions could arise with higher
%         probability, but they're still very unlikely.
%       - The vector transport was changed.
%       The typical distance was also modified, hopefully giving the
%       trustregions method a better initial guess for the trust region
%       radius, but that should be tested for different cost functions too.
%
%    July 11, 2014 (NB):
%       Added ehess2rhess and tangent2ambient, supplied by Bart.
%
%    July 14, 2014 (NB):
%       Added vec, mat and vecmatareisometries so that hessianspectrum now
%       works with this geometry. Implemented the tangent function.
%       Made it clearer in the code and in the documentation in what format
%       ambient vectors may be supplied, and generalized some functions so
%       that they should now work with both accepted formats.
%       It is now clearly stated that for a point X represented as a
%       triplet (U, S, V), the matrix S needs to be diagonal.
