function [X, A] = PCA_stochastic(A, k)
% Example of stochastic gradient algorithm in Manopt on a PCA problem.
% 
% PCA (principal component analysis) on a dataset A of size nxd consists
% in solving
% 
%   minimize_X  f(X) = -.5*norm(A*X, 'fro')^2 / n,
% 
% where X is a matrix of dimension dxk with orthonormal columns. This
% is equivalent to finding k dominant singular vectors of A, or k top
% eigenvectors of A'*A.
% 
% If n is large, this computation can be expensive. Thus,  stochastic
% gradient algorithms take the point of view that f(X) is a sum of many (n)
% terms: each term involves only one of the n rows of A.
%
% To make progress, it may be sufficient to optimize with respect to a
% subset of the terms at each iteration. This way, each individual
% iteration can be very cheap. In particular, individual operations have
% cost independent of n, because f or its gradient need never be evaluated
% completely (or at all in the case of f.)
%
% Stochastic gradient algorithms (this implementation in particular) are
% sensitive to proper parameter tuning. See in code.
