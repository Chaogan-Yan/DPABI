function essential_svd
% Sample solution of an optimization problem on the essential manifold.
%
% Solves the problem \sum_{i=1}^N ||E_i-A_i||^2, where E_i are essential
% matrices. Essential matrices are used in computer vision to represent the
% epipolar constraint between projected points in two perspective views.
%
% Note: the essentialfactory file uses a quotient R1/R2 representation to
% work with essential matrices. On the other hand, from a user point of 
% view, it is convenient to use the E representation  (a matrix of size
% 3-by-3) to give cost, gradient, and Hessian  information. To this end, we
% provide auxiliary files essential_costE2cost, essential_egradE2egrad, and
% essential_ehessE2ehess that convert these ingredients to their R1/R2
% counterparts.
