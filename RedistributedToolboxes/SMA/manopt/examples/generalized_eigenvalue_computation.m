% function [Xsol, Ssol] = generalized_eigenvalue_computation(A, B, p)
%
% Input: A is a real, symmetric matrix of size nxn,
%        B is a symmetric positive definite matrix, same size as A
%        p is an integer such that p <= n.
%
% Output: Xsol: a real, B-orthonormal matrix X of size nxp such that
%         trace(X'*A*X) is maximized, subject to X'*B*X = identity. 
%         That is, the columns of X form a B-orthonormal basis of a
%         dominant subspace of dimension p of B^(-1)*A. These are thus
%         generalized eigenvectors associated with the largest generalized
%         eigenvalues of B^(-1)*A  (in no particular order). Sign is
%         important: 2 is deemed a larger eigenvalue than -5.
%         Ssol: the eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors Xsol, in a
%         vector.
% 
% We intend to solve the homogeneous system A*X = B*X*S,
% where S is a diagonal matrix of dominant eigenvalues of B^-1 A.
%
%
% The optimization is performed on the generalized Grassmann manifold, 
% since only the space spanned by the columns of X matters in the
% optimization problem.
%
% The optimization problem that we are solving here is 
% maximize trace(X'*A*X) subject to X'*B*X = eye(p). 
% Consequently, the solutions remain invariant to transformation
% X --> XQ, where Q is a p-by-p orthogonal matrix. The search space, in
% essence, is set of equivalence classes
% [X] = {XQ : X'*B*X = I and Q is orthogonal matrix}. This space is called
% the generalized Grassmann manifold.
% Before returning, Q is chosen such that Xsol = Xq matches the output one
% would expect from eigs.
