function [X, info] = dominant_invariant_subspace(A, p)
% Returns an orthonormal basis of the dominant invariant p-subspace of A.
%
% function X = dominant_invariant_subspace(A, p)
%
% Input: A real, symmetric matrix A of size nxn and an integer p < n.
% Output: A real, orthonormal matrix X of size nxp such that trace(X'*A*X)
%         is maximized. That is, the columns of X form an orthonormal basis
%         of a dominant subspace of dimension p of A. These are thus
%         eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of A (in no
%         particular order). Sign is important: 2 is deemed a larger
%         eigenvalue than -5.
%
% The optimization is performed on the Grassmann manifold, since only the
% space spanned by the columns of X matters. The implementation is short to
% show how Manopt can be used to quickly obtain a prototype. To make the
% implementation more efficient, one might first try to use the caching
% system, that is, use the optional 'store' arguments in the cost, grad and
% hess functions. Furthermore, using egrad2rgrad and ehess2rhess is quick
% and easy, but not always efficient. Having a look at the formulas
% implemented in these functions can help rewrite the code without them,
% possibly more efficiently.

    % cost(XQ) = cost(X) for all Q orthogonal, then we see
