# DPABI: a toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging

[DPABI] (http://rfmri.org/dpabi) is a toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging, evolved from [DPARSF] (http://rfmri.org/DPARSF) (Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI) and contains [DPABISurf](http://rfmri.org/DPABISurf), [DPABIFiber](http://rfmri.org/DPABIFiber), DPABINet and BrainImageNet. Please refer to [The R-fMRI Course] (http://rfmri.org/Course) to know more about how to use this toolbox. Add with subfolders for DPABI in MATLAB's path setting and enter "dpabi" in the command window to enjoy this powerful toolbox.
